## API Endpoints
### Users
* `POST /api/signup/` with post parameters `{'email', 'full_name', 'phone', 'can_host', 'password', 'default_location_id'}` creates a new user. Email must be a Dartmouth email with an allowed class year. This returns a user_id.
* `POST /api/verify/:userID` with post parameter `{'verify_token'}` verifies a user and retrieves a token and user_id
* `POST /api/signin/` with post parameters `{'email', 'password'}` to retrieve a token and user_id
* `PUT /api/users/:userID` with parameters `{'email', 'full_name', 'phone', 'can_host', 'password' 'default_location_id' }` updates a user. This is not done yet.
* `GET /api/users/:userID` returns a user's info in the form `{'email', 'full_name', 'phone', 'can_host', 'default_location': {'_id', 'location_name'} }`. This requires a token.

### Locations
* `POST /api/locations/` with post parameters `{'location_name'}` creates a new location (you need to send a token, in CURL you'd do this with -H "Authentication: INSERT_TOKEN_HERE")
* `GET /api/locations/` returns all locations in the form `[{location_id: '123', location_name: 'Baker Library'}, {...}, ...]`

### Listings (All require token)
* `POST /api/listings/` with post parameters `{'location_id', 'host_user_id', 'num_looking_for_game', 'start_time'}`
* `GET /api/listings/` returns all listings in the form `{'listing_id', 'location_id', 'host_user_id', 'num_still_needed_for_game', 'start_time'}`
* `PUT /api/listings/:listingID` with parameters `{'location_id', 'host_user_id', 'num_looking_for_game', 'start_time'}` updates a listing
* `DELETE /api/listings/:listingID` deletes the listing
* `POST /api/listings/join/:listingID` with parameter `{'user_id'}` will join a listing
* `POST /api/listings/leave/:listingID` with parameter `{'user_id'}` will leave a listing

**NOTE: `num_looking_for_game` is part of Listing's schema, which represents the number of people that the host already knows will play (including the host, so if the host is with his friend trying to play, this number would be two). On the contrary, `num_still_needed_for_game` is calculated by the server, which is the number of people still needed to bring the game to a total of four players (in the host example above, this would also be two, since two are hosting (=num_looking_for_game), and two are needed (=num_still_needed_for_game).**

## Data Structures

### Users
*	user_id (unique string generated by Mongo)
* email (unique string, user's Blitz through Dartmouth Authentication)
*	full_name (string)
* class_year (determined from the user's email, stored internally in case we use it later)
*	phone (unique, int)
*	can_host (boolean)
*	default_location_id (string from Locations)
*	date_joined

### Locations
*	location_id (unique string generated by Mongo)
*	location_name (string)

### Listings
*	listing_id (unique string generated by Mongo)
*	location_id (string from Locations)
*	host_user_id (string from Users)
*	users (array of Strings, user id's)
*	num_looking_for_game (number of people the host has, including him/herself; if he needs 3fp, this would be 1)
*	start_time (UTC time when the game will start)
*	posted_time (UTC time when the listing was posted)
